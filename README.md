# Parallax Scrolling Project

This mini project demonstrates parallax scrolling, a technique where multiple elements on a webpage scroll independently in sync with each other, which ultimately gives the webpage 
a surreal 2.5D effect.


## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (colors, keyframes bounce animation, background manipulation, etc.)

Below is a live demo of the project.
